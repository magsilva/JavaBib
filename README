This is simply a checkin of the now somewhat stale javabib
project from
http://www-plan.cs.colorado.edu/henkel/stuff/javabib/20040801/

The license is unmodified (GPL v2), as is the code,
I'm the original author, I'm not sure I'll have time to
work on this, but I'm curious about code.google.com and
subversion so I thought I'd try this.

Cheers, Johannes.
